# World_Life_Expectancy_MySQL
The World Life Expectancy Project aims to analyze global health and demographic trends using structured datasets. Life expectancy is a key measure of a nationâ€™s well-being, reflecting the impact of healthcare, economic stability, and lifestyle factors.

# ðŸ”¹ Insights (from analysis of world life expectancy data)

Steady Global Growth: Overall life expectancy has been increasing worldwide, thanks to medical advancements and improved living standards.

Regional Disparities: Developed countries show life expectancies above 75 years, while several developing nations still average below 65.

GDP Correlation: Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have longer life expectancies, though outliers exist (wealth â‰  health in all cases).

Healthcare Investment: Nations that spend more on healthcare as a % of GDP generally show better life expectancy outcomes.

Infant Mortality Impact: High infant mortality rates strongly correlate with lower average life expectancy.

Lifestyle Diseases: In developed countries, chronic illnesses (heart disease, diabetes, obesity) are key factors limiting further gains in life expectancy.

# ðŸ”¹ Recommendations

Targeted Healthcare Programs: Developing nations should invest in preventive healthcare, vaccination drives, and maternal care to reduce early deaths.

Balanced Policy Approach: For richer nations, focus on reducing lifestyle-related diseases through awareness, healthier diets, and physical activity programs.

Global Knowledge Sharing: Encourage collaboration between developed and developing countries on healthcare technology, best practices, and funding.

Economic-Health Balance: Policies should not just aim at economic growth but ensure healthcare spending grows proportionally.

Data-Driven Planning: Governments and NGOs should use structured data analysis (like this project) to identify priority areas and measure impact over time.

Education & Awareness: Public health campaigns focusing on hygiene, nutrition, and mental health can drive long-term improvements in life expectancy.
